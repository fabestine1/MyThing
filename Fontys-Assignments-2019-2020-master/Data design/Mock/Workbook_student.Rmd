The overview of the tables we have used can be seen in this database model:

<img src = "images/Game.png" />

The content of each dataset is listed below:


```{sql connection=con}
SELECT *
FROM Order_List;
```

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT *
FROM Address;
```

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT *
FROM Orders;
```

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT *
FROM Parts;
```

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT *
FROM Available;
```



Given the Dataset from the business game can you:
1. Get the address corresponding to the order number 103.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT a.name, a.city, a.street FROM Address a
INNER JOIN order_list o
ON a.name = o.name
WHERE o.number == 103
```

2. All order numbers for each city.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT a.city, o.number FROM Address a
INNER JOIN order_list o
ON a.name = o.name

```

3. All parts for the order number 103.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT o.Number , p.Part FROM Orders o
INNER JOIN parts p
ON o.item = p.Part
where o.number == 103
```

4. The total number of parts required.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT count(Part)
from orders o, parts p
where o.Number = 103
```

5. Check if all parts are in the warehouse.

```{sql connection=con}


```

6. If some parts are missing, starting form 101, which order cannot be delivered. (manual)





7. Show in a graph the total number of ordered items per city.

```{sql connection=con}

```
